# CPA Landing Pages Collection

This repository contains a collection of static landing pages designed for various CPA (Cost Per Action) marketing offers. Each landing page is organized into its own dedicated folder.

---

## **Project Structure**

Each landing page is housed within its own folder, with the main HTML file named `index.html`. This structure is optimized for deployment via platforms like Cloudflare Pages, allowing each offer to be accessed via a unique URL path under the main domain.

Example structure:├── offer-1/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
├── health-offer/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── main.css
└── tech-gadget/
├── index.html
└── script.js

## **Deployment**

This collection is intended to be deployed as a static site using Cloudflare Pages. Once deployed, each landing page can be accessed via a URL like `https://yourdomain.com/offer-1`, `https://yourdomain.com/health-offer`, etc.
